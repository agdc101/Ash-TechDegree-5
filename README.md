# interactive-photo-gallery
This project was built from scratch using HTML, CSS/SASS and Jquery. This project uses a jquery plugin which allows the user to scroll between images
through the image modal, which is displayed when an image is selected. The page also contains a search bar which allows the user to search for particular\
images.
